.SYNOPSIS
Checks the Authenticode signature on SpoolSmith binaries.

.DESCRIPTION
Uses Get-AuthenticodeSignature rather than `signtool verify`: signtool ships
with the Windows SDK and is not present on a stock Windows 11 machine (see
docs/capture-report-review.md §2.4), so anyone who downloaded a release can run
this without installing anything.

Requires a countersigned timestamp, not just a valid signature. Azure Artifact
Signing certificates are valid for three days; an untimestamped signature stops
verifying almost immediately, and that failure would otherwise only show up on
a user's machine days after the release.

Exits non-zero if any file fails, so CI can gate a release on it.

.EXAMPLE
./scripts/verify-signature.ps1 -Files dist/spoolsmith.exe, dist/spoolsmith-gui.exe

.EXAMPLE
Get-ChildItem spoolsmith/*.exe | ForEach-Object { $_.FullName } |
    ForEach-Object { ./scripts/verify-signature.ps1 -Files $_ }
